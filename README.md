# Random Number Generator Program.




The Program is a rock paper scissors style game in which the item the NPC uses a randomly generated item. The game will go on until either the player or the NPC scores 5 points. After the game has end the player than can decide wheater or not if they want to keep playing or not. IF they don't want to play again the program end, and if they do want to play again the program starts the game back to square one.




The reason I created this program was to practice with working with class, and to make them not hard coded being flexable. In  which the output that the classes give can change depending on the inputs the classes recieve.
